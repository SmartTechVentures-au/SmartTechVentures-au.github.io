# Agile Coaching

> Our coaches focus on embedding Agile at the individual team level, using traditional Agile frameworks like **Scrum** and **Kanban**.

We may work with one or multiple teams, including interactions with groups outside of those teams. Our focus is on enabling and developing agility at the “make” or “build” level.

We ensure that teams are able to build products the right way and deliver work sustainably.
